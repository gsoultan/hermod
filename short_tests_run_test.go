// Every test skipped by -short must be run somewhere else.
//
// CI runs `go test -race -short ./...` because four worker load tests stand up
// 120 concurrent workflows apiece, and under Go 1.27 the race detector's shadow
// memory for those reached 8.73 GB against a 7GB runner. A separate step runs
// them at full scale without the detector.
//
// That split only works while the second step's -run expression actually names
// them. It stopped doing so almost immediately: TestWorkerSurvivesControlPlane-
// Outage carried a testing.Short() guard, matched none of the alternatives, and
// therefore ran nowhere at all — skipped by -short in both jobs and never
// selected by the load step. Nothing failed, because a test that does not run
// cannot fail. That is exactly the trade the split was introduced to avoid, and
// it happened anyway within a day.
//
// So the pairing is checked here rather than remembered. Adding a
// testing.Short() guard without extending a -run expression now fails the
// build, in the plain unit job, needing nothing but the source tree.
//
// There is more than one such step now — the load step and the allocation
// budget step — so every -run expression in the workflow counts, not just the
// first one found. Reading only the first would fail a test that a later step
// does run, which is a different way of being wrong about the same thing.
