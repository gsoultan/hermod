	// WorkerAdmissionRejected counts workflows a worker declined to start

	// one.

	// A gauge rather than a counter, and republished on every reaper sweep

	// mappings do not cover, and which were therefore not written.

	// This is how a source growing a column becomes visible. A mapped sink
	// writes only the columns it was told about, so a new field upstream is

	// SinkDeleteMatchedNothing counts deletes that found no row to remove.
	//
	// One is unremarkable: delivery is at-least-once, so a replayed delete
	// legitimately finds the row already gone. All of them is a broken
	// destination. A sink with no column mappings keys rows on the message's own
	// id, and whether that identifies a row depends on the source -- MySQL CDC
	// derives it from the primary key, while PostgreSQL and SQL Server use a
	// position in the log that differs for every event touching one row. In the
