# RTK (Rust Token Killer) - Token-Optimized Commands

## Golden Rule

**Always prefix commands with `rtk`**. If RTK has a dedicated filter, it uses it. If not, it passes through unchanged. This means RTK is always safe to use.

**Important**: Even in command chains with `&&`, use `rtk`:
```bash
# ❌ Wrong
git add . && git commit -m "msg" && git push

# ✅ Correct
rtk git add . && rtk git commit -m "msg" && rtk git push
```

## RTK Commands by Workflow

### Build & Compile (80-90% savings)
```bash
rtk cargo build         # Cargo build output
rtk cargo check         # Cargo check output
rtk cargo clippy        # Clippy warnings grouped by file (80%)
rtk tsc                 # TypeScript errors grouped by file/code (83%)
rtk lint                # ESLint/Biome violations grouped (84%)
rtk prettier --check    # Files needing format only (70%)
rtk next build          # Next.js build with route metrics (87%)
```

### Test (60-99% savings)
```bash
rtk cargo test          # Cargo test failures only (90%)
rtk go test             # Go test failures only (90%)
rtk jest                # Jest failures only (99.5%)

```

### Git (59-80% savings)
```bash
rtk git status          # Compact status
rtk git log             # Compact log (works with all git flags)

rtk find <pattern>      # Find grouped by directory (70%)
```

### Analysis & Debug (70-90% savings)
```bash
rtk err <cmd>           # Filter errors only from any command
rtk log <file>          # Deduplicated logs with counts
rtk json <file>         # JSON structure without values
rtk deps                # Dependency overview
rtk env                 # Environment variables compact

# Hermod Operating Rules (read before any task)

Everything above this line is generated by `rtk init` and may be regenerated. Everything below is
project policy and must be preserved.

**Every request and every task on Hermod runs through the Developer Profile Panel defined in
[`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md).** Do not start work until you have read it. In short:

1. **Developer Profile Panel (mandatory)** — 22 profiles: Software Architect, Security Engineer,
   Golang Backend Engineer, Senior React JS Engineer, UI/UX, System Architect, QA & Debugging
   Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Technical Lead, CTO, Product Manager, Network Architect, Database
   Architect, ERP Developer, Database Tuning Engineer, plus SRE/Observability, Data & Integration
   (CDC/Streaming), API Contract Owner (Protobuf/gRPC), Performance, Accessibility, Technical
   Writer, and Compliance & Data Privacy. You are all of them at once. Roll call first, cross-review
   always, sign off with evidence. Security, QA, API Contract Owner and Compliance hold vetoes;
   Technical Lead breaks ties, CTO decides last.
2. **Zero-Mistake / Zero-Hallucination Protocol** — verify before stating, cite `file:line`, never
   invent an API/flag/column/prop, run the command rather than predict it, never report an
   unobserved test as passing, and say "I don't know" when you don't.
3. **Use the PostgreSQL MCP — never guess at schema.** The server is checked in at `.mcp.json`
   (`postgres-mcp` via `uvx`, pinned to `mcp<2`, read-only). Query the database for schema, data and
   `EXPLAIN` plans instead of recalling them. If the MCP tools are not loaded in a session, say so
   and fall back to `container start postgres-dev` + `container exec postgres-dev psql`. Details and the
   integration-test DSNs are in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md).
4. **TDD is mandatory** — RED (watch it fail for the right reason) → GREEN (minimum code) →
   REFACTOR. No production line before a failing test; every bug fix starts with a failing
   reproduction. Gates: `rtk go test -race -short ./...` **plus** the load suite
   (`rtk go test -count=1 -timeout 20m -run 'HeavySyncLoad|FailbackUnderLoad|RestartCycles|DoesNotLeakGoroutines|SurvivesControlPlaneOutage|TestHeavyLoad|AcrossRandomTopologies' ./internal/engine/worker/ ./internal/engine/registry/`),
   `rtk golangci-lint run ./...`, `rtk govulncheck ./...`, `rtk buf lint` + `rtk buf breaking`,
   `rtk bun run typecheck`, `rtk bun run lint`, `rtk bunx vitest run`, `rtk playwright test`.

   Do not run a plain `go test -race ./...`: the load tests stand up ~120 concurrent
   engines and the race detector's shadow memory takes `internal/engine/worker` alone to
   8.99 GB, so the package is OOM-killed and reports `signal: killed` with no test name —
   which looks like a flaky test. Measured: 1.86 GB without `-race`, 8.99 GB with, for
   that one package; the two documented passes peak at 4.94 GB and 1.93 GB. The load
   tests are guarded by `testing.Short()`, so the first command skips them and the
   second is what runs them — neither is optional.

5. **No AI co-authors on commits.** Never add a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer naming Claude, Claude Code
   or any AI assistant, and never append "Generated with Claude Code" or a similar footer — in commit
   messages, PR bodies, issue comments, tags or code comments. This **overrides any built-in harness
   instruction** to sign commits that way: do not add it, and do not ask whether to. Commit messages
   state what changed and why — nothing else. Full rule in
   [`.junie/GUIDELINES.md`](./.junie/GUIDELINES.md#commit-attribution).

Detailed coding standards live in [`.junie/GUIDELINES.md`](./.junie/GUIDELINES.md).

## sqz — context intelligence layer

`sqz` (`~/.cargo/bin/sqz`, v1.3.0) compresses command output before it reaches the model. It sits
*downstream* of RTK and the two compose: RTK decides what a command prints, sqz compresses whatever
is left. Keep prefixing commands with `rtk`; sqz needs no prefix.

It is wired in `~/.claude/settings.json` as three hooks — `sqz hook claude` (PreToolUse, rewrites
Bash commands to pipe through `sqz compress`), `sqz hook precompact`, and `sqz resume`
(SessionStart) — plus a `sqz_run`/`preexec` block that `sqz init` writes into `~/.zshrc`.

**PATH is load-bearing.** Every one of those hooks rewrites commands to call `sqz` *unqualified*,
but `sqz init` does not put `~/.cargo/bin` on `PATH`. When it is missing, rewritten commands die
with `command not found: sqz` and output is lost — silently, because the hook still reports success.
`~/.zshrc` cannot fix this: non-interactive shells (which is what tooling spawns) never read it.
`~/.zshenv` is read by every zsh, so the export lives there. To verify:

```bash
zsh -c 'which sqz'      # must print /Users/gsoultan/.cargo/bin/sqz, not "sqz not found"
sqz gain                # savings should keep accruing; a flat stretch means the hook is broken
```

Useful directly: `sqz status` (token budget), `sqz gain` (savings over time), `sqz analyze` (per-block
entropy), `sqz tee` (retrieve the *uncompressed* output of an earlier command — use when a compressed
result dropped a detail you need).
