// Soak: resource behaviour over time rather than in a snapshot.
//
// Leaks do not show up in a thirty-second test. The sub-source reader goroutine
// that ignored cancellation looked perfectly healthy in isolation and only
// became obvious as a straight line upwards across repeated start/stop cycles;
// the same is true of heap growth from a pool that is fed but never drained.
// What distinguishes a leak from normal variation is the *trend*, so this
// samples over a sustained run and compares the second half against the first.
//
// Off by default — it is measured in minutes. Enable with:
//
