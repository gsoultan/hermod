// Package nodes is the one import that makes every workflow node type

// Each node registers itself from an init() that calls
// interfaces.RegisterNodeExecutor, so a node type exists only if its package is
// linked into the binary. Listing them here means a caller blank-imports this
// one package -- cmd/hermod/main.go does -- instead of tracking five, and a new
// node category is wired up by adding a line here rather than by remembering to
// edit main.
