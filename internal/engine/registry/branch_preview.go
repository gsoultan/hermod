// The editor's "Test" button used to have one path: the transformer registry.
// That covers every node whose job is to change a message, and none of the
// nodes whose job is to choose where it goes. switch, condition and router are
// registered as node executors and dispatched at runtime by
// executeNodeInternal, so a workflow containing them ran correctly while the
// preview of the same node answered
//
//	unknown transformation type "switch": no transformer is registered under that name
//
// which reads as a broken configuration rather than a preview that never looked
// in the right registry.
//
// Only executors that declare themselves interfaces.PreviewSafe run here. A
// node that exists but has not declared it is refused by name, because a
// preview is not a reason to write to a sink or record an approval.
