// Recording which schema a database is running.
//
// There is no versioned migration system here: Init creates the tables it knows
// about and autoMigrate adds any columns that are missing. That is a deliberate
// simplification, but it left "does this database match this binary?" with no
// answer at all — and a schema left half-applied by a failed migration
// indistinguishable from a complete one.
//
// So a fingerprint of the expected schema is written after a run that fully
// succeeds, and only then. Three questions become answerable from the database
// itself:
//
//		SELECT value FROM settings WHERE key = 'hermod.schema_fingerprint';
//
//	  - what last applied a schema here, by comparing it with SchemaFingerprint()
//	  - whether the binary has been downgraded, because the values differ
//	  - whether the last upgrade finished, because a failed migration leaves the
//	    previous value in place
//
// It is a fingerprint rather than a version number because there is nothing to
// number: no migration files, no ordering, and no down migrations. What it can
// honestly report is "the same schema" or "a different one".

	// SchemaFingerprintKey names the settings row holding the applied schema.

	// SchemaVersionKey names the settings row holding the schema version.
	SchemaVersionKey = "hermod.schema_version"
)

// currentSchemaVersion orders what the fingerprint can only compare.
//
// The fingerprint above answers "same schema or a different one", and
// deliberately stops there — a digest has no direction. But the two directions
// are not equally safe. Running a *newer* binary against an older database is
// what Init is for: autoMigrate adds what is missing. Running an *older* binary
// against a database a newer one already migrated is the dangerous one, and it
// is the one that happens under pressure — a rollback after a bad release, or a
// rolling upgrade briefly running both binaries against one metadata database.
// Every statement in Init is IF NOT EXISTS, so the old binary starts perfectly
// cleanly and then reads and writes a schema whose shape it does not know.
//
// So the version supplies the ordering, and the fingerprint keeps it honest: a
// test fails if the DDL changes without this being reconsidered, which is what
// stops it silently drifting out of date the way a hand-maintained number
// otherwise would.
//
// Bump it when a change would confuse an older release — a new table it does
// not know to populate, a column it would leave empty that a newer one
// requires. Do not bump it for a change an older binary can ignore, such as an
// added index. This exists to block dangerous rollbacks, and a number that
// moves for harmless reasons blocks safe ones.
